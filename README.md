# hello_world

My name is Leo. I began loading coding in the middle of 2018 at 26 years old.
I am interested in Python right now to write code for my first automation project.
I will be automating a probe calibration fixture for my company.
The project will entail the following:
1. Setting up a raspberry pi using raspbian.
2. Soldering a Adafruit Pi Stepper Hat to the Raspberry Pi
3. Installing the necessary programs to communicate between the Raspberry Pi and the Pi Hat
4. Controlling a stepper motor using the Adafruit Pi Hat, Stepper Motor Model 17HS03-1004S
  a. This will be to move the target material away from the probe tip.
5. Connecting a multimeter to the raspberry pi and getting data using a Python library
  a. This voltage information will eventually be plotted and output to a calibration form.
6. Checking that the linearity of the probe plot is within an acceptance range.
  a. Adding a Pass/Fail mechanism for each probe.
7. Building a GUI for this project so the technician can enter the data needed at the beginning of the program and press start.
8. Automatically sending the report to the printer with the results.
9. Automatic storage of the resulting calibration files in a database.
